= 1. Introduction

icon:clock-o[Duration: 10 Minutes] Duration: 10 minutes

Welcome to the  lab where we will explore the *{event_name} {lab_name}*! In this lab, we’ll explore AAP’s configuration options using Configuration as Code principles. As we work through a hands-on scenario, we’ll also delve into the underlying configuration details to understand how AAP is deployed and becomes fully functional through Configuration as Code.

// TODO: Add intro 

== Overview and Goals

In this, opening, module, we will explore the lab goals, our environment and introduce the Configuration as Code Methodology in Ansible Automation Platform and get ready to install the needed components in Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform 2, typically referred to as *AAP2* or *AAP* from now on for brevity.

== Lab Goals

* *Familiarize participants with AAP concepts:* Help users explore key features and architecture of AAP, laying a foundation for Configuration as Code.

* *Hands-on Configuration as Code deployment:* Guide users in building and deploying configurations step-by-step, showing best practices for applying Configuration as Code within AAP.

* *Organize and structure AAP objects:* Encourage users to organize their AAP environments by efficiently managing inventories, playbooks, roles, and other objects.

[CHALLENGE]
====
* *Earn points by completing stages:* Gamify the experience by awarding points as participants complete each stage, with Red Hat swag up for grabs!

== Current Requirements

Containerized AAP2 requires Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 or later.

*First Challenge:* Go to https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html-single/containerized_installation/index[The AAP 2.5 Containerized Documentation,window=read-later], and find about the deployment topologies, then solve the first challenge using this link: https://red-hat-summit-connect-hands-on-day-2024.ctfd.io/challenges#1%20-%20How%20many%20topology%20shapes%20does%20the%20AAP%202.5%20Containerized%20Installer%20offers?-33[First Challenge Link,window=read-later]

[#topology]
== Lab Topology

Our lab topology is quite simple and can be divided logically into 3 components: 

- One `bastion` host, the machine you will primarily work from.

- Two VMs for Containerized AAP2 infrastructure, allowing for a 2-Tier deployment with a separate Postgres instance

[INFO]
====
`2-Tier` deployment means we separate the database (Postgres) layer from the application (AAP) layer.
====

- Two target hosts to deploy a simple application as part of the lab.

|===
|Server |Operating System|External Interface|Role

|bastion
|RHEL 9.3
|Yes
|DevOps Server - you will primarily work from here

|aap2
|RHEL 9.3
|Yes
|Primary AAP2 Platform for Gateway, Controller, Hub, and EDA

|aap2-database
|RHEL 9.3
|No
|Postgres database - you will install this 

|app-frontend
|RHEL 9.3
|Yes
|Simple frontend for test application

|app-backend
|RHEL 9.3
|No
|Simple backend for test application

|===

The terminals to your right are logged in via `ssh` to the bastion as the `devops` user. You can directly `ssh` to any of the hosts in your environment. You will run the installer from `bastion` but your Containerized AAP2 will deploy to `aap2` and your Postgres database to `aap2-database`

NOTE: All instances are running RHEL 9.3 and are sized appropriately for the lab.
