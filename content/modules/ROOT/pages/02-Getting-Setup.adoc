== Explore your environment

Several artifacts and tools have been installed for you. Let's take a look at what is available.

[TIP]
====
Occasionally at events like conferences network issues arise, and this can be unpredictable. If you have issues running the above command and losing the connection and in turn breaking the install you can use `tmux` as a workaround.

. Use `tmux` to create a tmux session which you can re-attach to.
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
tmux new -t aap2
----

. You can re-attach to tmux via:
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
tmux attach -t aap2
----
Hopefully, however, this scenario will not arise.

TIP: Some of the packages we are installing are already installed. However, we are following the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/aap-containerized-installation#system_requirements[Installation Guide] here are it is worth seeing what dependencies are expected

NOTE: In the unlikely event that you see any failures, please ask for assistance.

== Optional: Customization your Environment

Your environment is now ready for you to customize, if there are tools and editors you prefer or shell settings, exports etc you would like to make.
The lab will take approximately 60-90 minutes so you can take a moment to add your favorite tools, aliases, etc. to make your environment your own.
For example any of your favorite tools such as linters, `ripgrep`, `neovim` etc. 

You may also want to consider adjusting your environment to your taste or perhaps your `~/.vimrc`, `~/.bashrc` etc. You'll be on this host for 90 minutes so take a moment to make it your own.

. If you want to install any tools from EPEL you can use the following command to add EPEL. In Production, we would recommend not using EPEL.

== Summary

In this section, we simply set up our `bastion` host with the necessary tooling before installation. In addition, there was the option to tune the toolchain to reflect personal preferences.

TODO: Safe to delete the remainder?


We will start by installing the `community.postgresql` collection. This collection will be used to install the PostgreSQL database server.

As you watch the airport, you might notice that really what we're doing is where unpackaging I'm at sport collection that contains the controller installer and other collections. Then near the end, you may notice that the bundle extracts a number of compressed container images and this is primarily because the controller installer will use these images to deploy the controller and the hub.
