= Configuring the Containerized AAP2 Installer Inventory

icon:clock-o[Duration: 15 Minutes] Duration: 15 minutes

Now we are ready to configure our installation. In your home directory, you will find a compressed tar file with the Containerized AAP2 installer. Just as with the older Ansible Tower, and also the installer for Automation Controller for servers, VMs, or cloud instances the installer relies on the configuration of an Ansible inventory.

Remember, currently, as discussed in Module 1, this is still a Technical Preview. The installer is available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux across two architectures x86 and Arm. In addition, it is available in two formats, a lightweight installer, which assumes both Internet access and a Red Hat Network login and the bundled installer. 

We will use the bundled installer which includes all its dependencies, including the container images for the major components and also for the execution environments, etc. We will explore these during the installation process.

== Unpack and Explore the Installer

. Ensure you are in the home directory of the `devops` user
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
cd
----

. Unpack the installer, using `tar` with the `-v` (verbose) option, so you can see the components being unpacked
+

[TIP]
====
It is worth watching the output of the `tar` extraction as this will give you a feel for the major components, which we will briefly explore.
====
+

As the tar archive unpacks you will see there are two major components to the bundle installer, *collections* and the *bundle* itself is largely composed of container images of components (controller, hub, etc.), supporting infrastructure (postgres, redis), and the Execution Environments. The unbundled installer pulls these in at install time and is considerably smaller.

== Configuring your Inventory

In this section you will configure your inventory, logically this can be seen as 6 main components


. Automation Gateway
. Automation Controller
. Automation Hub
. Automation EDA (Event Driven Ansible)
. Postgresql
. AAP Controller Postinstall  (Optional, covered in next Module)

=== Editing the Inventory

All basic configuration for the AAP2 Containerized Installer is done via the `inventory-growth` file. The full inventory file is in the `inventory` file. We will overwrite the `inventory-growth` to `inventory` for simplicity.

[TIP] 
====
You can take a look at the `inventory` file before overwriting it, with the command of your choice i.e. `less`, `cat`, `more`
====


[TIP] 
====
Your machine, `bastion` comes with both `vim` and `nano` pre-installed but `mc` (Midnight Commander), `neovim`, and `emacs` are all available via `dnf` e.g. `sudo dnf install -y mc` etc. Please feel free to install your favorite editor.

Those of you using Visual Studio Code on your laptops or similar are welcome to use the `ssh` vars in the *Resources and Credentials* Module for remote editing however setup and configuration are not covered in the lab.
====

. Rename your inventory-growth file for editing using your editor of choice:
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
mv inventory-growth inventory
----

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
vim inventory
----

. Configure the Groups for Gateway, Controller, Hub, and EDA
+

As you can see the inventory is partially configured for a local install eg on a single local VM. However, in our case, we will be placing the gateway, controller, hub, and EDA on a single remote host. Recall that we can distribute them more widely with 1 component per VM etc - the installer is very flexible.
+

[NOTE]
In our example, all `ssh` is set up already, feel free to explore `/home/devops/.ssh/config` In many cases you may need to make changes either there or in the inventory file. A good simple test is `ansible all -m ping -i inventory` to validate configuration and ssg setup.
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]

# This is the AAP growth installer inventory file
# Please consult the docs if you're unsure what to add
# For all optional variables please consult the included README.md
# or the Red Hat documentation:
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation

# This section is for your AAP Gateway host(s)
# -----------------------------------------------------
[automationgateway]
aap2.{guid}.internal
# This section is for your AAP Controller host(s)
# -----------------------------------------------------
[automationcontroller]
aap2.{guid}.internal

# This section is for your AAP Automation Hub host(s)
# -----------------------------------------------------
[automationhub]
aap2.{guid}.internal

# This section is for your AAP EDA Controller host(s)
# -----------------------------------------------------
[automationeda]
aap2.{guid}.internal
----

. Configure the remote, Postgres `database` group and associated vars 
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# This section is for the AAP database
# -----------------------------------------------------
[database]
#aap2

[all:vars]
postgresql_admin_username=postgres
postgresql_admin_password=r3dh4t1!
----
+

[NOTE]
====
These are set to match the pre-configured vars in the previous module. 

You could also in this section point to an appropriately configured PostgreSQL DBaaS such as AWS's RDS. (Not recommended if you are not deploying the rest of your infrastructure on the same cloud/VPC).
====

. Configure the Common Variables - Section 1
+

For clarity, we will break configuring the remaining Common Variables in `[all:vars]` into several sections. Starting with the registry and bundle configuration. Because we have pre-placed the bundle installer on your host we do not need to access the registry as the images are stored in the bundle.
+

The next section should look like this
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# Common variables
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/appendix-inventory-files-vars#ref-general-inventory-variables
# -----------------------------------------------------

bundle_install=true
# The bundle directory must include /bundle in the path
bundle_dir=/home/devops/ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-bundle-2.5-1-x86_64/bundle


redis_mode=standalone
----
+

[TIP]
====
In the field, if you are not copying from a lab don't forget that the `bundle_dir` is not just the installer directory but also needs the `/bundle` at the end of the `bundle_dir` path.
====

. Configure the Common Variables - Gateway
+

In this section, we will configure the Gateway, and associate it with the Postgres instance we configured earlier. 
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# AAP Gateway
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/appendix-inventory-files-vars#ref-gateway-variables
# -----------------------------------------------------
gateway_admin_password=r3dh4t1!
gateway_pg_host=aap2-database.{guid}.internal
gateway_pg_password=r3dh4t1!
gateway_validate_certs=false

----

. Configure the Common Variables - Controller
+

In this section, we will configure the Controller, and associate it with the Postgres instance we configured earlier. Getting slightly ahead of ourselves we will also do the initial setup of the `Postinstall` feature which is the topic of the next module.
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# AAP Controller
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/appendix-inventory-files-vars#ref-controller-variables
# -----------------------------------------------------
controller_admin_password=r3dh4t1!
controller_pg_host=aap2-database
controller_pg_password=r3dh4t1!

# AAP Controller - optional
# -------------------------
# To use the postinstall feature you need to set these variables
controller_postinstall=true
controller_license_file=/home/devops/manifest.zip
controller_postinstall_dir=/home/devops/config-as-code
----

. Configure the Common Variables - Automation Hub
+

This section is straightforward and we will point at the same database as before.
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# AAP Automation Hub
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/appendix-inventory-files-vars#ref-hub-variables
# -----------------------------------------------------
hub_admin_password=r3dh4t1!
hub_pg_host=aap2-database
hub_pg_password=r3dh4t1!
----

. Configure the Common Variables - Automation EDA (Event Driven Ansible)
+

This section is straightforward and we will point at the same database as before.
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# AAP EDA Controller
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/appendix-inventory-files-vars#event-driven-ansible-controller
# -----------------------------------------------------
eda_admin_password=r3dh4t1!
eda_pg_host=aap2-database
eda_pg_password=r3dh4t1!
----

== Part 1 of the Installation Configuration Complete

You have now completed the first step of your configuration and if you were not using the new `postinstall` feature you should be ready to start the installation.

. Before moving on to the next module quickly do a simple `ping` to see that the Ansible Groups you configured are correct
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
ansible all -m ping -i inventory
----
+

.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
aap2 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----

== Summary

Hopefully, you will agree that the configuration of the `inventory` is quite straightforward. Also, it should be apparent how you could configure all sorts of different scenarios via the inventory groups ranging from an "all in one" install on a single node to a completely distributed one service per node type install.
