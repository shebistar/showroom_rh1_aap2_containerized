= 4. Configuring the AAP2 Installer Inventory

icon:clock-o[Duration: 15 Minutes] Duration: 15 minutes

Now that we’re set up, let's proceed with configuring the Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2 installation. In your home directory, you’ll find a compressed tar file containing the Containerized AAP2 installer.

Just like previous Ansible Tower installations and the Automation Controller installers for servers, virtual machines, and cloud instances, this installer depends on configuring an Ansible inventory. This inventory specifies the configuration details necessary for the installation process.

Installer Options for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL): The AAP2 installer is available for RHEL in two architectures—x86 and Arm—and offers two formats:

*Lightweight Installer:* Requires both Internet access and a Red Hat Network login to pull in dependencies during installation.

*Bundled Installer:* Self-contained and includes all dependencies, such as container images for essential components and execution environments.

For this setup, we’ll use the bundled installer to ensure all dependencies are included, allowing us to proceed without external downloads. During the installation process, we’ll explore the included components, including container images for the primary services and execution environments.

== Unpack and Explore the Installer

. Ensure you are in the home directory of the `devops` user
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
cd
----

. Unpack the installer, using `tar` with the `-v` (verbose) option, so you can see the components being unpacked
+

[TIP]
====
It is worth watching the output of the `tar` extraction as this will give you a feel for the major components, which we will briefly explore.
====
+

As the tar archive unpacks you will see there are two major components to the bundle installer, *collections* and the *bundle* itself is largely composed of container images of components (controller, hub, etc.), supporting infrastructure (postgres, redis), and the Execution Environments. The unbundled installer pulls these in at install time and is considerably smaller.

== Configuring your Inventory

In this section you will configure your inventory, logically this can be seen as 6 main components


. Automation Gateway
. Automation Controller
. Automation Hub
. Automation EDA (Event Driven Ansible)
. Postgresql
. AAP Postinstall  (Optional, covered in next Module)

.Containerized Architecture Components

=== Editing the Inventory

==== Container Topologies
The containerized installer deploys Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) using Podman to run the platform in containers on host machines. This deployment model allows customers to manage both the product and infrastructure lifecycle independently.

==== Container Growth Topology

The growth topology is designed for organizations new to Ansible Automation Platform who do not yet require high availability or substantial computing resources for large-scale automation. This topology is optimized for smaller, low-footprint deployments, making it an ideal starting point for most organizations.

==== Infrastructure Topology

The Infrastructure Topology is available for customers choosing to self-manage Ansible Automation Platform.

All primary configurations for the AAP2 Containerized Installer are handled through the inventory-growth file. For simplified setup, we’ll replace inventory-growth with the main inventory file to consolidate all configurations.

[CHALLENGE]
====
*Fifth Challenge:* Based on the previous information solve the quiz: https://red-hat-summit-connect-hands-on-day-2024.ctfd.io/challenges#5%20-%20Which%20Container%20Topology%20works%20better%20for%20organizations%20new%20to%20AAP-38[Fifth Challenge Link,window=read-later]
====

[TIP]
====
Before overwriting, you can inspect the existing inventory file by using commands like less, cat, or more to view its configuration.
====


[TIP] 
====
Your machine, `bastion` comes with both `vim` and `nano` pre-installed but `mc` (Midnight Commander), `neovim`, and `emacs` are all available via `dnf` e.g. `sudo dnf install -y mc` etc. Please feel free to install your favorite editor.

Those of you using Visual Studio Code on your laptops or similar are welcome to use the `ssh` vars in the link:Resources-and-Credentials.html[*Resources and Credentials*] Module for remote editing whatever setup and configuration are not covered in the lab.
====

. Rename your inventory-growth file for editing using your editor of choice:
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
mv inventory-growth inventory
----
+

[TIP]
====
If you decide to use vim, it is recommended to configure the /home/devops/.vimrc file with the following values:
[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
autocmd FileType yaml setlocal ai ts=2 et nu cuc cursorline
----
====
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
vim inventory
----

. Configure the Groups for Gateway, Database, Controller, Hub, and EDA
+

As you can see the inventory is partially configured for a local install on a single local VM. However, in our case, we will be placing the gateway, controller, hub, and EDA on a single remote host, and the `postgresql` database in ahother host. Recall that we can distribute them more widely with 1 component per VM etc - the installer is very flexible.
+

[TIP]
====
All the variables for the `inventory` file are described in the documentaiton https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html-single/containerized_installation/index#inventory_file_for_online_installation_for_containerized_growth_topology_all_in_one[here]
====
+

[NOTE]
====
In our example, all `ssh` is set up already, feel free to explore `/home/devops/.ssh/config` In many cases you may need to make changes either there or in the inventory file. A good simple test is `ansible all -m ping -i inventory` to validate configuration and ssg setup.
====
+

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `inventory` has default values. Replace the values to match the lab infrastructure. You *must* compare the template on the left with the `inventory` file you are modifying on the right, otherwise the installation will fail.
====

# This is the AAP growth installer inventory file
# Please consult the docs if you're unsure what to add
# For all optional variables please consult the included README.md
# or the Red Hat documentation:
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation

# This section is for your AAP Gateway host(s)
# -----------------------------------------------------

# This section is for your AAP Controller host(s)
# -----------------------------------------------------
[automationcontroller]

# This section is for your AAP Automation Hub host(s)
# -----------------------------------------------------
[automationhub]
aap2.{guid}.internal

# This section is for your AAP EDA Controller host(s)
# -----------------------------------------------------
[automationeda]

----

. Configure the remote, Postgres `database` group and associated vars 
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# This section is for the AAP database
# -----------------------------------------------------
[database]
aap2-database.{guid}.internal

----
+

[NOTE]
====
These are set to match the pre-configured vars in the previous module. 

You could also in this section point to an appropriately configured PostgreSQL DBaaS such as AWS's RDS. (Not recommended if you are not deploying the rest of your infrastructure on the same cloud/VPC).
====

. Configure the Common Variables - Section 1
+

For clarity, we will break configuring the remaining Common Variables in `[all:vars]` into several sections. Starting with the registry and bundle configuration. Because we have pre-placed the bundle installer on your host we do not need to access the registry as the images are stored in the bundle.
+

The next section should look like this
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# Common variables
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/appendix-inventory-files-vars#ref-general-inventory-variables
# -----------------------------------------------------
[all:vars]
postgresql_admin_username=postgres
postgresql_admin_password=r3dh4t1!

bundle_install=true
# The bundle directory must include /bundle in the path
bundle_dir='{{ lookup("ansible.builtin.env", "PWD") }}/bundle'


redis_mode=standalone
----
+

[TIP]
====
In the field, if you are not copying from a lab don't forget that the `bundle_dir` is not just the installer directory but also needs the `/bundle` at the end of the `bundle_dir` path.
====

. Configure the Common Variables - Gateway
+

In this section, we will configure the Gateway, and associate it with the Postgres instance we configured earlier. 
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# AAP Gateway
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/appendix-inventory-files-vars#ref-gateway-variables
# -----------------------------------------------------
gateway_admin_password=r3dh4t1!
gateway_pg_host=aap2-database.{guid}.internal
gateway_pg_password=r3dh4t1!

----

. Configure the Common Variables - Controller
+

In this section, we will configure the Controller, and associate it with the Postgres instance we configured earlier. Getting slightly ahead of ourselves we will also do the initial setup of the `Postinstall` feature which is the topic of the next module.
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# AAP Controller
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/appendix-inventory-files-vars#ref-controller-variables
# -----------------------------------------------------
controller_admin_password=r3dh4t1!
controller_pg_host=aap2-database.{guid}.internal
controller_pg_password=r3dh4t1!

# AAP Controller - optional
# -------------------------
# To use the postinstall feature you need to set these variables
controller_postinstall=true
controller_license_file=/home/devops/manifest.zip
controller_postinstall_dir=/home/devops/config-as-code
----

. Configure the Common Variables - Automation Hub
+

This section is straightforward and we will point at the same database as before.
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# AAP Automation Hub
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/appendix-inventory-files-vars#ref-hub-variables
# -----------------------------------------------------
hub_admin_password=r3dh4t1!
hub_pg_host=aap2-database.{guid}.internal
hub_pg_password=r3dh4t1!
----

. Configure the Common Variables - Automation EDA (Event Driven Ansible)
+

This section is straightforward and we will point at the same database as before.
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# AAP EDA Controller
# https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html/containerized_installation/appendix-inventory-files-vars#event-driven-ansible-controller
# -----------------------------------------------------

eda_pg_password=r3dh4t1!
----

== Part 1 of the Installation Configuration Complete

You have now completed the first step of your configuration and if you were not using the new `postinstall` feature you should be ready to start the installation.

. Before moving on to the next module quickly do a simple `ping` to see that the Ansible Groups you configured are correct
+

[source,ini,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
ansible all -m ping -i inventory
----
+

.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
aap2 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----

== Summary

Hopefully, you will agree that the configuration of the `inventory` is quite straightforward. Also, it should be apparent how you could configure all sorts of different scenarios via the inventory groups ranging from an "all-in-one" install on a single node to a completely distributed one service per node type install.
