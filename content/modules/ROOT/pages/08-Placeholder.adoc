== Initial Configuration

| NOTE: Now is a great time to add any of your favorite tools `rg`, `nvim` etc. You'll be on this host for ~90 minutes so take a moment to make it your own. 

. First, we will get our Ansible environment set up.

TIP: Some of the packages we are installing are already installed. However, we are following the Installation Guide (LINK) here are it is worth seeing what dependencies are expected

 as you watch the airport, you might notice that really what we're doing is where unpackaging I'm at sport collection that contains the controller installer and other collections. Then near the end, you may notice that the bundle extracts a number of compressed container images and this is primarily because the controller installer will use these images to deploy the controller and the hub.



. Change into the directory

. Examine the basic structure of the installer

== Configuring the Inventory


TIP: It is very easy for a subtle typo to cause a lot of frustration. Take care and double check your work.

. Open the inventory file in your favorite editor (vim, nano, etc)




. Setup your 








== Downloading the UBI

In this lab, you will be installing software into the container 
image running as an interactive application. To do this you will
need `yum`, but do not need `systemd` for managing services within the
container environment.  For that reason, you will be using the *Standard*
UBI image (as opposed to the Minimal or Multi-service images).

Using the "buildah from" command will download and meld the container image. This particular image we are using is the Red Hat Universal Base Image or UBI. From the ourput of the command, you will notice that we are pulling down the latest one, which is for RHEL 9. 

. Execute the  download the Standard UBI
image from Red Hat's registry.

+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
buildah from registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/ubi
----

[#repositories]
== Installing Repositories
In this lab, you are going to containerize a software package that is already
packaged in RPM format and stored in the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux
(EPEL) repository.

Software often has requirements for prerequisite software that must be installed
on the machine for it to work properly.  `yum` will resolve those
dependencies for you, as long as it can locate the required packages in
repositories defined on the machine.  The Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI)
downloaded in the previous step has access to some Red Hat Enterprise Linux
repositories.  However, the target package for the lab is from EPEL.  

. In the command below, `buildah` is going to run a command on the
`ubi-working-container` image.  The `--` indicates that the command should be
executed from within the container, which means the results will be applied into
the container image.  Lastly, you are providing the `yum` command to install a
package that defines all of the repositories from EPEL, `epel-release-latest-9`.

+
[source,bash]
----
buildah run ubi-working-container -- yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm
----


. You can verify that the above command did not install the RPM on the host system.

+
[source,bash]
----
rpm -q epel-release
----

NOTE: If your repository configurations are not distributed as an RPM, but instead as
individual `.repo` files, you could use the `buildah copy` command to copy
files from the host operating system into the container image.  You will see
an example of using `buildah copy` later in this lab.

[#software]
== Installing Software


. Now that the yum repositories are defined within the container, execute 
another `yum install`, within the container, to install the target
software: `moon-buggy`.

+
[source,bash]
----
buildah run ubi-working-container -- yum -y install moon-buggy
----


== Committing the Container Image

. At this point, the container is configured.  It is time to transition from a
working container into a committed image.  In the command below, you will use
the `buildah` command to commit the working container to an image called:
`moon-buggy`.

+
[source,bash]
----
buildah commit ubi-working-container moon-buggy
----

+
. The output of `podman image list` should confirm the image was created.

+
[source,bash]
----
podman image list
----


== Deploy the Container

Now the software has been installed and a new container image created.  It is
time to spawn a runtime of the container image and validate the software.  The
software we are using is a command line command.  

. When you `run` the container,
it will be in interactive (`-it`) mode, based on the `moon-buggy` container
image and the command run interactively will be `/usr/bin/moon-buggy`.

+
[source,bash]
----
podman run -it moon-buggy /usr/bin/moon-buggy

. You can now play the Moon Buggy game, which is a text-based version of the
popular Moon Patrol.  When you are finished, use the `q` command to quit the
game, which will terminate the container.

Alternatively, you can use `podman` to kill the running container from
*Terminal 2*.
