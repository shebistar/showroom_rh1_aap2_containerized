= Setting up a Postgres Database for AAP2

icon:clock-o[Duration: 10 Minutes] Duration: 10 minutes

In this module, we will discuss about our Postgres backend for Containerized AAP2 using our bundled installer.

== Why install Postgres in a different VM?

Given that the installer for Containerized AAP2 supports creating and running a Containerized version of Postgres, why are we installing it in another VM? The Containerized AAP2 installer supports a very flexible mix of architectural choices including:

* All-in-One: All components Controller, Hub, EDA and Postgres on 1 node
** This is useful for dev/testing and also for example for a laptop VM
* All distributed: Every component on its VM
* Two-tier: Separate Database

[NOTE]
====
Not all components need to be installed, for example, if you don't need Hub or EDA, you can omit their configuration/installation. I.e. by commenting out the relevant parts of the installer inventory.
====

The Two-tier architecture also provides several advantages:

* Clear separation of concerns
* Avoid potential I/O issues around Container Volumes
* Allow for the use of I/O optimized Servers and/or Cloud Instances

[NOTE]
====
The Red Hat Demo Team who deployed this lab makes use of both optimized instances (IO Optimized via NVMe drivers for example to sustain higher I/O ops) and cloud-based DBaaS. The infrastructure for your lab today used AWS RDS as the database backend for AAP2.

TODO: Should I remove all this or are there peices of content worth re-using

for example a complete all in one where everything including post runs on a single host to a completely distributed model, where each component runs on its own BM.

In addition, the installer allows the end-user to supply their own grass instance. This is a flexible option and allows for not only a separation of concerns, but for automation teams to leverage centrally, managed databases by dedicated database teams, but also the optioiNOTEn of using a cloud based DBA, such as RDS.

NOTE: important to understand the support model of using external pass grass, and it's beyond the scope of this lack lab to cover this.

* Databases are often IO bound and separation allows for the use of dedicated instances and IO optimization
** Cloud Providers for example support both IO-optimized instance types (NVMe drives etc)
** Cloud Providers also

NOTE: It is beyond the scope of this lab to cover the support implications of externally self hosted or cloud-hosted Postgres.

== Postgres Requirements


== How

This lab provides a simple Postgres installer already configured to work in our environment. It simply leverages the following role and collection

* `geerlingguy.postgresql`
* `community.postgresql`

. Change into the Postgres installer repository directory
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
cd postgres-for-aap2
----

. Explore the Postgres installer - it is quite simple in its construction
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
tree -L 2
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
.
├── ansible.cfg
├── group_vars
│   └── aap2_databases.yml
├── install-postgresql.yml
├── inventory
├── README.adoc
└── requirments.yml
----
+

. If you like take a moment to explore the repository which is quite simple a little deeper, perhaps the most interesting file being the `group_vars/aap2_databases.yml` primarily used for configuring the `geerlingguy.postgresql` role.
+

[NOTE]
====
It is the var file where we set the Postgres password which will be used later by the AAP2 installer. For simplicity, we recommend you do not change it in this lab situation.
====

. Next let's install the necessary dependencies (role and collection) which have been isolated and versioned in the `requirements.yml` file, via `ansible-galaxy`
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
ansible-galaxy install -r requirments.yml
----
+

.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
Starting galaxy role install process
- downloading role 'postgresql', owned by geerlingguy
- downloading role from https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-postgresql/archive/3.5.0.tar.gz
- extracting geerlingguy.postgresql to /home/devops/.ansible/roles/geerlingguy.postgresql
- geerlingguy.postgresql (3.5.0) was installed successfully
Starting galaxy collection install process
Process install dependency map
Starting collection install process
Downloading https://galaxy.ansible.com/api/v3/plugin/ansible/content/published/collections/artifacts/community-postgresql-3.2.0.tar.gz to /home/devops/.ansible/tmp/ansible-local-4317wlygz9ue/tmp4sdy5sio/community-postgresql-3.2.0-c08ov_a8
Installing 'community.postgresql:3.2.0' to '/home/devops/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/community/postgresql'
----

. Finally, run the installer playbook which simply acts as a wrapper around the role you just installed.
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
ansible-playbook install-postgresql.yml
----
+

.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]

[TIP]
====
Several of the most common issues we see with remote Postgres installations include:

. Ensuring that Postgres listens on an *external* network interfaces
. Password authentication is set up correctly
. Firewalls and Cloud Security Groups are configured
** In our case we have preconfigured AWS Security Groups and Firewalld

====
+

If you are curious as to the first 2 points, they are configured in the vars in `group_vars/aap2_databases.yml` and then set via the `geerlingguy.postgresql` role.

==== Basic Checklist for broken Postgres Installs

. `[]` Is it running! (`ps -ef`)
. `[]` Can I access it locally (e.g.) *and* authenticate
. `[]` Can I access the port, typically 5432, across the network

////
== Summary

This module is now complete, we will install a Postgres database with the Containerized AAP2 Installer.

In the next module, we will unpack the AAP2 Containerized Installer and configure our inventory for installation.
