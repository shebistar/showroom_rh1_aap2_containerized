= 5. Postinstall Capability

icon:clock-o[Duration: 15 Minutes] Duration: 15 minutes

A new feature in the Containerized Installer is the link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_ansible_automation_platform/2.5/html-single/containerized_installation/index#ref-controller-variables[Postinstall] capability

This enables your AAP2 infrastructure to come up both with its manifest already inserted but also Controller resources including:

* Organizations
* Inventories
* Groups
* Hosts
* Credentials
* Projects
* Job Templates 

Or any other resource capable of being installed by the powerful `infra.controller_configuration` link:https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/infra/controller_configuration/[collection] fully documented link:https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/infra/controller_configuration/docs/[here]. 

You can view all the collections contained within the bundled installer with the `ansible-galaxy` command. 

. Ensure the `ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH` env var is set

----
export ANSIBLE_COLLECTIONS_PATH=/home/devops/ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-bundle-2.5-3-x86_64/collections

[configure]
== Create a Complete Postinstall Example

In this section, we will create a complete application deployment scenario creating all the resources up to and including a `job_template`.  After the installation is complete we will manually run the `job_template` to both work hands-on with the Containerized AAP2 Console and to check that the Postinstall feature works as expected in creating resources.

You will see the Controller Console is identical to other AAP2 deployment platforms (Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenShift, or a Cloud-Based AAP2 such as provided by Azure and AWS). 

. Recall that in the prior module whilst configuring the inventory you edited this section:
+

As long as it matches the below no further edits should be necessary
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
# AAP Controller - optional
# -------------------------
# To use the postinstall feature you need to set these variables
controller_postinstall=true
controller_license_file=/home/devops/manifest.zip
controller_postinstall_dir=/home/devops/config-as-code
----

. Validate the Automation Controller manifest exists
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
ls /home/devops/manifest.zip
----
+

.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
/home/devops/manifest.zip
----

. Ensure you are in your home directory and create the config-as-code directory
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
cd; mkdir config-as-code
----

. Add a `controller` sub-directory for a good structure and `cd` into it
+

[TIP]
====
This of course could easily be a Git Repository which you could easily clone.
====
+

[source,sh,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
mkdir config-as-code/controller
cd config-as-code/controller
----

. Create a new file `credentials.yml` in the `config-as-code/controller` folder, and enter the following YAML list:
+

[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
---
controller_credentials:

  - name: rhsummit-demo-credential
    credential_type: Machine
    organization: Default
    inputs:
      username: ec2-user
      ssh_key_data: "{{ lookup('file', '/home/devops/.ssh/' + GUID + 'key.pem') }}"
----
+


[NOTE]
====
If you want to add further AAP2 Resources (Inventories, Projects etc) you can refer to the document link:https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/infra/controller_configuration/content/role/organizations/[linked earlier]. Your file names, e.g. `credentials.yml` etc should match the names of the roles in the collections with the postfix `.yml`

[NOTE]
====
In the final line, we directly reference a variable `GUID` which is both part of the FQDN of our hosts and also the name of our SSH key (`<GUID>key.pem`). Since our installer has no visibility of the var `GUID` we will have to pass it to the installer at run time ie via `-e GUID={guid}`.

Alternatively, we could hard code it but the above approach is superior and allows easy re-use of a `config-as-code` repo.
====

[WARNING]
====
We will skip creating organizations, and we will use the `Default` organization for our Lab. In upcoming AAP 2.5 versions, it will be possible to create organizations via the `post_install` feature.

== Summary

In this module, we added the necessary files and directories to test out the new Postinstall feature available in the TechPreview AAP2 Installer.

In the next module, we will run the Installer and explore the new infrastructure.
